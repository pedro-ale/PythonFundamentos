We consider first a (polynomial) basis function regression, then a (vanilla) artificial neural network (ANN).

Models learn from samples simulated in the Black & Scholes model.\n",

Each scenario consists in a sample $\\left(X, Y \\right)$, where $X = S_1$ is the underlying asset price in 1y, and $Y = max \\left( 0, S_2 - K \\right)$ samples the corresponding payoff of the call in 2y in the same scenario. \n",

        "We now implement a vanilla neural network to perform the regression in place of conventional linear or polynomial (or any other type of basis) regressions. Neural networks don't regress on a fixed set of basis functions, they learn the best functions (also known as features, or best representation in ML lingo), from the data, in their hidden layers, by composing activated combinations of previous layers. This is what allows neural networks to scale to high dimensional inputs, regressing on a low number of \"best\" representations, while the number of monomials (or any other kind of fixed basis functions) would increase exponentially in a conventional regression. With low dimensional problems like our simple example, we should expect neural nets to perform at least as well as conventional regression.\n",

Another natural choice is the similar softplus function $softPlus\\left( x \\right) = \\log \\left( {1 + {e^x}} \\right)$. ELU has been (empirically) shown to improve training over the classic $relu\\left( x \\right) = {x^ + }$. ELU has linear asymptotes, which is the desired behaviour in valuation problems: financial products are often linearly extrapolated and this behaviour is often enforced. For example, in finite difference methods, we generally work with linear boundary conditions. ELU is also considered a best practice presently in the deep learning community, for very different reasons related to speed and stability of numerical optimization."
